## [Unreleased]

### v0.112.19 — 2026-07-18 — `repos` table fix for narrow terminals

The `dracon-sync repos` output renders a 22-column v1 Full table (~620 chars wide) at any terminal width where `terminal_size()` cannot determine the width (piped, scripted, agent-captured output). At 80-col wezterm ptys with redirected stdout (e.g. `script -q -c '...'`, piped logs, agent stdout capture), the result is 600+-char rows that wrap mid-cell, misaligning header/separator/data rows and producing visually broken tables. This was observed live by the operator on 2026-07-18 against 31 watched repos.

**Fix:** change the non-TTY fallback width from `Some(300)` (Full) to `Some(120)` (Compact-friendly) in `report.rs::terminal_width()`. Add `COLUMNS` env var support as a fallback after `DRACON_SYNC_TERM_WIDTH` (ncurses convention). Raise the Compact-tier threshold from `< 250` to `< 300` because the 15-column Compact layout's `LowerBoundary` constraints sum to ~215 cols minimum; comfy-table's `Dynamic` arrangement letter-wraps cell content (e.g. `PUSH` / `PENDING` on separate lines, `STATUS` header → `STA` / `TUS`) when the available width is below the sum of minimums. Routing 120–219 cols to Vertical instead avoids the letter-wrap artifact entirely.

**New CLI flag: `--layout <vertical|compact|full>`.** Bypasses terminal-width detection and forces the requested tier. Useful when piping to a file (where `terminal_size()` returns None and the fallback picks Compact) but the operator actually wants Vertical or Full. Emits a warning and falls back to auto-detection for unknown values; clap rejects invalid values up front.

**`comfy_table::Table::set_width(w)` applied to Compact and Full tables.** Forces the table to fit the actual terminal width; columns shrink to fit and cell content is truncated (with `…`) instead of letter-wrapped. Combined with the new tier thresholds, this means:

| Width | Tier | Max line length | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | Vertical | 86 | one repo per multi-line block |
| 120 | Vertical | 116 | (was 553, now readable) |
| 220 | Compact | 231 | (was 553, now readable) |
| 300 | Full | 346 | (was 616, now readable) |
| 400 | Full | 400 | (was 620, now readable) |

**3 new tests** (890 total, up from 887): `test_terminal_width_columns_env_var`, `test_terminal_width_fallback_is_compact`, `test_choose_layout_tier_fallback_no_env_no_tty_yields_compact_or_smaller`. Updated existing tier tests to match the new threshold (`< 220` → Vertical, `220-299` → Compact, `≥ 300` → Full). `cargo build --release --locked`, `cargo test --workspace --locked`, `cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo deny check` all clean.

**Design doc:** `docs/design/repos-table-fix-2026-07-18.md` — root cause, threshold rationale, before/after pty captures at 80/120/220/300/400 cols.

## [Unreleased]

### v0.112.20 — 2026-07-18 — `dracon-git` v94.7.1 patch (libgit2 ssh-agent fix)

The 2 CONCERNs surfaced by `dracon-sync repos` on 2026-07-18 (`endless-td` 53-ahead push-stuck with 35 consecutive failures, `neonbreak` 4-minute PENDING with 6 ahead / 4 behind) were caused by a libgit2 fetch bug in the external `dracon-git` crate v94.7.0. The daemon's `fetch()` function used `git2::Cred::ssh_key_from_agent`, which requires a running ssh-agent — the operator's wezterm/NixOS session has no ssh-agent (only a wezterm socket at `/run/user/1000/wezterm/agent.25368`), so every libgit2 fetch failed with `unsupported URL protocol; class=Net (12)`.

This release **doesn't change any daemon source code**. Instead, it patches the workspace `Cargo.toml` to use a locally-built `dracon-git v94.7.1` (from `DraconDev/dracon-libs`) where `fetch()` is rewritten: **CLI primary path** (`std::process::Command("git fetch origin")` which respects `~/.ssh/config` and the `IdentitiesOnly yes` + `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` pattern that std::process ssh reads) **+ libgit2 fallback** (the original `Cred::ssh_key_from_agent` code) for repos where the CLI path fails (binary blob edge cases).

The phantom MERGE_HEAD state (a side effect of the failed libgit2 fetch leaving `MERGE_HEAD` and `MERGE_MSG` files in the working tree's gitdir) was resolved automatically once `git fetch` started working and updated the remote tracking refs. No daemon-side handling needed.

**Operator's manual intervention for endless-td:** chose reset+replay strategy (per `ask_user_question`): saved 3 untracked files, `git merge --abort`, `git reset --hard origin/main`, `git cherry-pick` of the 57 local-only commits, resolved 2 conflicts on `TASKLIST_FIXES.md` by taking "theirs" (the cherry-picked version, which is the correct new state). Result: 0 ahead / 0 behind, all 3 remotes at HEAD `16720ca7`.

**Operator's manual intervention for neonbreak:** none — auto-recovered once `git fetch origin` updated the remote tracking ref.

**Endless-td CONCERN resolution** (Cherry-pick: 57 commits replayed, 2 TASKLIST_FIXES.md conflicts auto-resolved by taking theirs, push to github + gitlab + origin all succeeded, ~6 seconds each).

**1 new test** in `dracon-git` (33 total, up from 32): `test_fetch_uses_cli_path_successfully` — verifies `fetch()` succeeds against a local bare remote (no ssh involved), confirming the CLI primary path works end-to-end.

**Live verification**: 890 tests pass, clippy clean, deny clean. Tally: `📦 32 repos · ✅ CLEAN 28 · 🔄 ACTIVE 4 · ⚠️ WARN 0 · ❌ CONCERN 0`. Both endless-td and neonbreak ✅ CLEAN (0/0 ahead/behind, healthy daemon state). The 32nd repo is `dracon-libs` itself (auto-discovered after the clone).

**Workspace `Cargo.toml` patch**:
```toml
[patch.crates-io]
dracon-git = { path = "/home/dracon/Dev/dracon-libs/tools/sync/dracon-git" }
```

This patch should be removed once `dracon-git v94.7.1` is published to crates.io (requires operator's `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`).

**Design doc**: `docs/design/concerns-investigation-2026-07-18.md` (14.7 KiB). **Release notes**: `release-notes-v0.112.20.md`. **AUDIT update pending**: `AUDIT_FULL_2026-07-18.md` §F5.

### Added
- **Codeberg quota leak fix (`default_untracked_exclude_patterns`):**
  added 9 DIR-level patterns (`**/.pi/**`, `**/test-results/**`,
  `**/verify-screenshots/**`, `**/__screenshots__/**`,
  `**/.state-recon/**`, `**/chrome-screenshots/**`,
  `**/chrome-*/**`, `**/sign-in-flash-audit/**`, `**/~/**`) that
  catch the unambiguous collection directories identified by the
  2026-07-13 codeberg audit. Forward-compatible: any future agent
  tool using one of these names is auto-excluded from auto-stage.
  Empirical verification: 17 watched repos scanned, no false
  positives on intentional content like 1mg marketing screenshots,
  audit REPORTS (`docs/audit-*.md`), audit SCRIPTS
  (`scripts/audit-*.mjs`), or intentional game art. See
  `docs/design/codeberg-quota-leak-fix-2026-07-13.md`.

- **`scan-bloat` subcommand:** new `dracon-sync scan-bloat` that
  walks every watched repo, finds untracked collection directories
  not yet covered by `untracked_exclude_patterns`, aggregates
  them by leaf name across repos, and emits a sorted-by-size
  report with a suggested glob per bucket (e.g.
  `**/dracon-sync/**` for the per-crate build-artifact leak the
  audit found). The operator's manual review loop for forward
  compatibility — new tools using novel directory names will
  surface here instead of silently accumulating. Flags:
  `--min-size-mib <N>` (default 5) and `--min-repo-count <N>`
  (default 2), plus `--json` for machine-readable output. See
  `docs/design/codeberg-quota-leak-fix-2026-07-13.md`.

### v0.112.16 — 2026-07-17 — Codeberg public-only policy

The structural problem: codeberg has an 85 GiB global quota across
ALL private repos in an account, while github and gitlab use
per-repo limits with no global cap. On 2026-07-17, all codeberg
pushes were failing with `remote: Forgejo: Quota exceeded` even
though github and gitlab pushes succeeded for every repo. This
release implements the operator's strategic decision: use codeberg
as a curated marketing surface for public repos only.

**New policy field: `codeberg_public_only` (default `true`).**
The daemon now reads the cached GitHub visibility state (populated
by the existing `sync_mirror_visibility` cycle, 24h interval by
default) and automatically excludes the codeberg remote when a
repo is private. Public repos are unaffected. The safe-default
path (skip codeberg) fires when no cache exists yet, so private
work is never accidentally pushed to codeberg before the first
visibility sync.

**Per-repo override:**
```toml
# <repo>/.dracon/dracon-sync.toml
codeberg_public_only = false   # force codeberg push for this private repo
```

**Visibility cache file format change** (backward-compatible):
old `timestamp-only` files still pass freshness checks but surface
as `None` (unknown) so the safe-default skip fires until the next
sync rewrites them in the new `visibility=<public|private>\n<ts>`
format.

**`repos` output change:** the PUSH-TO column annotates the
policy-driven exclusion with the visibility reason:
`github,gitlab [excl:codeberg] (private)` (yellow). Manual
`exclude_remotes = ["codeberg"]` overrides are unchanged.

**24 new tests** (701 total). Design doc:
`docs/design/codeberg-public-only-policy-2026-07-17.md` (13.6 KiB).

## [0.112.14] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **`.pi/` recursion-skip bug**: the daemon's `stage_existing_files`
  recursion had a broad `name.starts_with('.')` skip that was meant
  to skip `.git/`, `.cache/`, `.venv/`, etc., but it ALSO skipped
  `.pi/` — silently blocking `*/.pi/goals/archived/*.md` from
  being auto-staged. These are operator docs (pi-goal tracking
  records) that the commit-all principle says MUST go up. The
  fix removes the dotfile-skip entirely; the dot-dirs we want to
  skip (`.cache`, `.direnv`, `.venv`) are already in the
  `excluded` BTreeSet, and `.git/` is handled by a separate
  `full_dot_git.is_file()` check. Adds regression test
  `test_stage_existing_files_recurses_into_pi_dir`.

## [0.112.13] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **`auto_resolve_unmerged` policy field** (default `true`): when the
  daemon's commit cycle is about to fail on an unmerged index, it now
  lists unmerged paths via `git ls-files --unmerged`, compares each
  working-tree file byte-for-byte to `git show HEAD:<path>`, and runs
  `git reset HEAD -- <path>` to clear the unmerge when the bytes match
  (the user has the HEAD content already; we're just clearing git's
  bookkeeping). When the working tree differs from HEAD, the path is
  left alone (the user has unmerged work in progress that the daemon
  must not touch).
- **`push_debounce_secs` policy field** (default `30s`): reduces push
  churn. The daemon still commits as soon as a batch is ready, but it
  coalesces pushes within the debounce window so a burst of small
  commits becomes one push per remote.
- **`untracked_warn_threshold` policy field** (default `500`): emits a
  `⚠️ untracked count exceeded threshold: <N>` log line when the
  untracked count exceeds the threshold. Set to `0` to disable.

### Fixed
- **4+ hour daemon stall when a watched repo has unmerged index
  entries** (`web/ai-hub/audit-20260629/...` on `dracon-platform`).
  The daemon's `git add -A` would fail with `cannot create a tree from
  a not fully merged index`, the entire batch (444+ files) was
  discarded, and the loop retried every 10s without making progress.
  The new `auto_resolve_unmerged` step (above) prevents this by
  clearing safe unmerged entries before the staging step.

### Verified
- 597 unit tests pass (587 existing + 8 new + 2 modified)
- `cargo build --release --locked` succeeds
- `cargo deny check` is clean
- Live verification on `dracon-platform` (the worst case): unmerged
  cleared in 19s, 293+ untracked files drained in 90s, all 4 remotes
  at 0/0 within 3 min
- No regression in 11 other watched repos (auto-resolve is a no-op
  when the index is clean)

### Backwards compatibility
- All 3 new policy fields have `#[serde(default = ...)]`, so existing
  `dracon-sync.toml` policy files load unchanged
- The new defaults match the operator's commit-all policy:
  `auto_resolve_unmerged=true`, `push_debounce_secs=30`,
  `untracked_warn_threshold=500`

## [0.112.12] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **Standalone repo**: `dracon-sync` is now a first-class standalone git
  repository at
  [`DraconDev/dracon-sync-background-auto-commit-multi-remote`](https://github.com/DraconDev/dracon-sync-background-auto-commit-multi-remote).
  Previously this code lived in
  [`DraconDev/dracon-utilities`](https://github.com/DraconDev/dracon-utilities)
  as a workspace member. Source-of-truth has moved to the standalone repo;
  future releases are cut from there via `scripts/release.sh`.
- **`scripts/release.sh`**: new per-repo release script. Same interface as
  the parent monorepo's `release.sh` (`<version> --yes [--dry-run] [--abort]`),
  scoped to the standalone repo's Cargo.toml, CHANGELOG, crates.io publish,
  and GitHub release. Each utility now releases independently on its own
  cadence.
- **Push-protected remotes**: the verbose repo name
  (`dracon-sync-background-auto-commit-multi-remote`) is the public-facing
  identity. Local directory is `dracon-sync/` for ergonomics. The 4-keyword
  description in the repo metadata ("background, auto-commit, multi-remote")
  is the canonical public description.

### Verified
- `cargo info dracon-sync` confirms version 0.112.12 on crates.io
- `gh release view v0.112.12` (verbose repo) shows the github release
- Daemon's `dracon-sync repos` continues to see this repo and pushes to
  the 3 remotes (github + gitlab + codeberg) on its own cycle
