## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`auto_resolve_unmerged` policy field** (default `true`): when the
  daemon's commit cycle is about to fail on an unmerged index, it now
  lists unmerged paths via `git ls-files --unmerged`, compares each
  working-tree file byte-for-byte to `git show HEAD:<path>`, and runs
  `git reset HEAD -- <path>` to clear the unmerge when the bytes match
  (the user has the HEAD content already; we're just clearing git's
  bookkeeping). When the working tree differs from HEAD, the path is
  left alone (the user has unmerged work in progress that the daemon
  must not touch).
- **`push_debounce_secs` policy field** (default `30s`): reduces push
  churn. The daemon still commits as soon as a batch is ready, but it
  coalesces pushes within the debounce window so a burst of small
  commits becomes one push per remote.
- **`untracked_warn_threshold` policy field** (default `500`): emits a
  `⚠️ untracked count exceeded threshold: <N>` log line when the
  untracked count exceeds the threshold. Set to `0` to disable.

### Fixed
- **4+ hour daemon stall when a watched repo has unmerged index
  entries** (`web/ai-hub/audit-20260629/...` on `dracon-platform`).
  The daemon's `git add -A` would fail with `cannot create a tree from
  a not fully merged index`, the entire batch (444+ files) was
  discarded, and the loop retried every 10s without making progress.
  The new `auto_resolve_unmerged` step (above) prevents this by
  clearing safe unmerged entries before the staging step.

### Verified
- 597 unit tests pass (587 existing + 8 new + 2 modified)
- `cargo build --release --locked` succeeds
- `cargo deny check` is clean
- Live verification on `dracon-platform` (the worst case): unmerged
  cleared in 19s, 293+ untracked files drained in 90s, all 4 remotes
  at 0/0 within 3 min
- No regression in 11 other watched repos (auto-resolve is a no-op
  when the index is clean)

### Backwards compatibility
- All 3 new policy fields have `#[serde(default = ...)]`, so existing
  `dracon-sync.toml` policy files load unchanged
- The new defaults match the operator's commit-all policy:
  `auto_resolve_unmerged=true`, `push_debounce_secs=30`,
  `untracked_warn_threshold=500`

## [0.112.12] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **Standalone repo**: `dracon-sync` is now a first-class standalone git
  repository at
  [`DraconDev/dracon-sync-background-auto-commit-multi-remote`](https://github.com/DraconDev/dracon-sync-background-auto-commit-multi-remote).
  Previously this code lived in
  [`DraconDev/dracon-utilities`](https://github.com/DraconDev/dracon-utilities)
  as a workspace member. Source-of-truth has moved to the standalone repo;
  future releases are cut from there via `scripts/release.sh`.
- **`scripts/release.sh`**: new per-repo release script. Same interface as
  the parent monorepo's `release.sh` (`<version> --yes [--dry-run] [--abort]`),
  scoped to the standalone repo's Cargo.toml, CHANGELOG, crates.io publish,
  and GitHub release. Each utility now releases independently on its own
  cadence.
- **Push-protected remotes**: the verbose repo name
  (`dracon-sync-background-auto-commit-multi-remote`) is the public-facing
  identity. Local directory is `dracon-sync/` for ergonomics. The 4-keyword
  description in the repo metadata ("background, auto-commit, multi-remote")
  is the canonical public description.

### Verified
- `cargo info dracon-sync` confirms version 0.112.12 on crates.io
- `gh release view v0.112.12` (verbose repo) shows the github release
- Daemon's `dracon-sync repos` continues to see this repo and pushes to
  the 3 remotes (github + gitlab + codeberg) on its own cycle
